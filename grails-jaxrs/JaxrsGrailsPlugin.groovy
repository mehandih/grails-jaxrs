    def description = """A plugin that supports the development of RESTful web services based on the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JSR 311: JAX-RS). It is targeted at developers who want to structure the web service layer of an application in a JSR 311 compatible way but still want to continue to use Grails' powerful features such as GORM, automated XML and JSON marshalling or Grails filters, to mention a few. This plugin is an alternative to Grails' built-in mechanism for implementing RESTful web services and is backed up by Jersey, the JSR 311 reference implementation. """
