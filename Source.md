# Repositories #

Since version 0.5 the grails-jaxrs sources (including the full project history) have been moved to a new [GitHub respository](http://github.com/krasserm/grails-jaxrs). To clone this repository run

```
git clone git://github.com/krasserm/grails-jaxrs.git
```

from the command line. Developers with read/write access to the public repository should run

```
git clone git@github.com:krasserm/grails-jaxrs.git
```

Branches and tags up to version 0.4 are still available in the project's old [Subversion repository](http://code.google.com/p/grails-jaxrs/source/browse/).
