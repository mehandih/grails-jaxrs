This release is mainly a bugfix and maintainance release.

  * ...
  * Upgrade to Grails 1.3.1
  * Upgrade to Jersey 1.2
  * Upgrade to Restlet 2.0-RC3

==Known issues==

  * There's a bug ([http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=971 issue 971]) in Restlet 2.0-RC3 that forces implementors of {{{MessageBodyReader}}} and {{{MessageBodyWriter}}} to *directly* implement these interfaces. Extending a class that implements these interfaces doesn't work. Restlet will ignore the provider in this case.
