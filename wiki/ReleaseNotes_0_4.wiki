==What's new==

This release is mainly a bugfix and maintainance release.

===Additions===
  * [GettingStarted#Generate_WADL Automated generation of WADL documents] (with some [http://code.google.com/p/grails-jaxrs/issues/detail?id=17 known limitations])
  * Upgrade to Grails 1.3.1
  * Upgrade to Jersey 1.2
  * Upgrade to Restlet 2.0-RC3

===Fixes===
  * [http://code.google.com/p/grails-jaxrs/issues/detail?id=18 Object ids in XML or JSON requests are not set on the domain object].
  * [http://code.google.com/p/grails-jaxrs/issues/detail?id=21 Unmarshalling from JSON (and XML) to nested domain objects doesn't work properly]

==Known issues==

  * There's a bug ([http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=971 issue 971]) in Restlet 2.0-RC3 that forces implementors of {{{MessageBodyReader}}} and {{{MessageBodyWriter}}} to *directly* implement these interfaces. Extending a class that implements these interfaces doesn't work. Restlet will ignore the provider in this case. 

==Upgrade notes==
