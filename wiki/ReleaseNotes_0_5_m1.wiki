==Known issues==

  * There's a bug ([http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=971 issue 971]) in Restlet 2.0-RC3 that forces implementors of {{{MessageBodyReader}}} and {{{MessageBodyWriter}}} to *directly* implement these interfaces. Extending a class that implements these interfaces doesn't work. Restlet will ignore the provider in this case. An upgrade to the current Restlet 2.0.5 release is planned for the next milestone or release candidate.

==Upgrade notes==
